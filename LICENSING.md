# Licensing

Sonido is available under a dual license model.

## Open Source — AGPL-3.0-or-later

The source code in this repository is licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE).

You are free to use, study, modify, and redistribute Sonido under the terms of
the AGPL-3.0. This means any software that incorporates Sonido (including
network-accessible services) must also be released under the AGPL-3.0 and make
its complete source code available.

This license is ideal for:
- Academic and research projects
- Open-source audio tools and plugins
- Personal learning and experimentation
- Contributing back to the community

## Commercial License

A commercial license is available for organizations that need to integrate
Sonido into proprietary products without the AGPL-3.0 copyleft obligations.

A commercial license is required if you want to:
- Ship Sonido in a closed-source DAW plugin (CLAP, VST3, AU)
- Embed Sonido in commercial hardware (guitar pedals, rack units, embedded DSP)
- Use Sonido in a proprietary desktop or mobile application
- Offer Sonido as part of a closed-source SaaS product
