//! Limiter kernel — pure DSP with separated parameter ownership.
//!
//! This is the kernel-architecture equivalent of [`Limiter`](crate::Limiter).
//! The DSP math is identical; the difference is structural:
//!
//! - **Classic `Limiter`**: owns `SmoothedParam` for threshold/output,
//!   manages smoothing internally, implements `Effect` + `ParameterInfo` directly.
//!
//! - **`LimiterKernel`**: owns ONLY DSP state (circular delay buffers, gain
//!   reduction envelope, cached coefficients). Parameters are received via
//!   `&LimiterParams` on each processing call. Deployed via
//!   [`KernelAdapter`](sonido_core::KernelAdapter) for desktop/plugin, or called
//!   directly on embedded targets.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! 1. **Lookahead buffering**: Input is written to circular delay buffers for L and R.
//!    The audio output is read from the far end of the buffer (delayed by
//!    `lookahead_samples`), so gain reduction is applied before the transient arrives.
//! 2. **Peak detection**: The lookahead window is scanned every sample for the peak
//!    absolute amplitude across both channels (linked stereo: `max(|L|, |R|)`).
//!    This is `O(lookahead_samples)` per sample.
//! 3. **Gain computation**: If `peak > threshold_linear` the required gain factor is
//!    `G = (threshold / peak) * ceiling_linear`. Otherwise `G = ceiling_linear`.
//! 4. **Gain smoothing**: One-pole filter — instant attack (follow gain down immediately
//!    when a new peak requires more reduction), exponential release (follow gain back up
//!    slowly when the peak passes):
//!    - `if target < g[n-1]: g[n] = target`
//!    - `else: g[n] = α · g[n-1] + (1 − α) · target`
//!    where `α = exp(-1 / (release_ms · sr / 1000))`.
//! 5. **Output**: Delayed sample × smoothed gain × output_level.
//!
//! # Stereo Linking
//!
//! Peak detection uses `max(|L|, |R|)` so a transient on either channel causes
//! identical gain reduction on both. This preserves the stereo image under heavy
//! limiting.
//!
//! # Latency
//!
//! The kernel reports `lookahead_samples` as its processing latency. The
//! [`KernelAdapter`](sonido_core::KernelAdapter) forwards this to the host via
//! `Effect::latency_samples()`, enabling the host to compensate for the delay.
