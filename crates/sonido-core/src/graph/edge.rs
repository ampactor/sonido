//! Graph edge types for the DAG routing engine.

//! An `Edge` connects two nodes, representing audio signal flow from a source
//! node to a destination node. During schedule compilation, edges are mapped to
//! virtual buffer IDs via liveness analysis; the edge itself does not store
//! buffer assignments.

/// Unique identifier for an edge in the processing graph.
///
/// Edge IDs are assigned sequentially and never reused within a graph instance.
