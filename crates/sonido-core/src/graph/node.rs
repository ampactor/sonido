//! Graph node types for the DAG routing engine.
//!
//! Each node in the processing graph has a [`NodeId`] and a [`NodeKind`] that
//! determines its role: audio input/output, effect processing, signal splitting,
//! signal merging, or a nested sub-graph.  The `NodeData` struct bundles the kind
//! with internal bookkeeping (adjacency lists, per-node bypass state, and rate).
