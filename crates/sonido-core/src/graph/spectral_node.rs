//! Spectral processing as a graph primitive.
//!
//! `SpectralNode` wraps an FFT at its input and an IFFT at its output. Any
//! effect chain placed between them operates entirely in the frequency domain.
//! This enables spectral compression, spectral gate, spectral morph, and
//! frequency-domain EQ as first-class graph citizens.
//!
//! # Signal Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! time-domain input

//! # Latency
//!
//! Processing latency equals `fft_size` samples.  The graph engine's latency
//! compensation inserts a matching delay on all parallel dry paths when a
//! `SpectralNode` is present (ADR-025).
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Types defined.  FFT/IFFT implementation requires a `no_std`-compatible FFT
//! crate (`microfft` recommended).  Overlap-add and window buffers are stubs.
