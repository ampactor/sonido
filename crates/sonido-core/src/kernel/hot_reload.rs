//! Hot-reload kernel support via cdylib swap.
//!
//! Compile a kernel to cdylib, load via dlopen, swap function pointer
//! in `KernelAdapter` while preserving smoother state. Development mode:
//! `cargo watch` triggers recompile + hot-swap on file save.
//!
//! # Workflow
//!
//! 1. Build kernel crate as `cdylib` (add `[lib] crate-type = ["cdylib"]`).
//! 2. Construct a [`HotReloadConfig`] pointing at the build output directory.
//! 3. Load via `HotKernel::load` (not yet implemented — returns placeholder).
//! 4. Swap into a running `KernelAdapter` without restarting the audio thread.
//!
//! Smoother state is preserved across swaps so parameter changes remain glitch-free.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Types defined. Runtime loading (`dlopen` / `libloading`) not yet implemented.

/// Handle to a dynamically loaded kernel.
///
/// Wraps a native shared library handle, resolved function pointers for the
/// [`DspKernel`](crate::kernel::DspKernel) vtable, and a monotone version tag
/// used to sequence concurrent swap requests.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// - `_private` will be replaced by the live fields once `libloading` is wired in.
/// - The handle must be kept alive for as long as any audio thread calls the
///   function pointers it provides.
